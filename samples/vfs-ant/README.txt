 this is a simple ant script that copyies a remote zip file to a blobstore container
   1. export ANT_OPTS to include log4j.xml as the property 'log4j.configuration'
      - ex. export ANT_OPTS="-Dlog4j.configuration=file://`pwd`/log4j.xml"
   2. find or download a copy of jclouds-vfs-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
      - ex. ~/.m2/repository/org/jclouds/jclouds-vfs/1.0-SNAPSHOT/jclouds-vfs-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
      - ex. curl http://jclouds.rimuhosting.com/maven2/snapshots/org/jclouds/jclouds-vfs/1.0-SNAPSHOT/jclouds-vfs-1.0-20091215.023231-1-jar-with-dependencies.jar >jclouds-vfs-all.jar
   3. invoke ant, adding the library above, and passing the property 'jclouds.blobstore.url' which corresponds to the provider you wish
      - ex. ant -lib ~/.m2/repository/org/jclouds/jclouds-vfs/1.0-SNAPSHOT/jclouds-vfs-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -Djclouds.blobstore.url=blobstore://user:hex_key@cloudfiles
      - ex. ant -lib ~/.m2/repository/org/jclouds/jclouds-vfs/1.0-SNAPSHOT/jclouds-vfs-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -Djclouds.blobstore.url=blobstore://hex_uid:base64_key@atmos
